allprojects {
    repositories {

        jcenter()
    }
}
```
Open [`Build.gradle`](app/build.gradle) file of `app` module and then..
```groovy
dependencies {
    //Android Paging Libray
    implementation "android.arch.paging:runtime:1.0.1"

    //Firebase Pagination Library
    implementation 'com.shreyaspatil:FirebaseRecyclerPagination:1.0.1'
